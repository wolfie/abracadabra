How to build
------------

Things you'll need to develop and test abracadabra:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Clone the repository and then at the root of your local copy install the dependencies with yarn:

	yarn

Now everything should be good to go.

You can execute tests with the command

	yarn test

and run a local web server serving the application with the command

	yarn start

While the server is running the application is available at `http://localhost:8080/`.
